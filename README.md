Simulated project inspired by Epic Clinical Analyst workflows analyzing synthetic EHR data.

# Clinical Workflow Analysis

This project is part of my ongoing journey into data analysis. I‚Äôm using healthcare-related data to explore trends across age and gender, while building and showcasing skills in **Excel** and, eventually, **SQL**.

As I learn and expand the analysis, this project will continue to grow‚Äîwith more insights, visualizations, and exploratory techniques layered in over time.
